    "After some thinking, you decide that it would be easier to navigate though your schedule if you could see all the events ordered by the weekday on which they are scheduled. In order to do so, you want to sort all the events by the weekdays of their `event_date`s, meaning that Monday events should come first, Tuesday events should come next, and so on, with Sunday events coming last. In the case of a tie, the `participants` should be a tie-breaker; an event with the largest number of `participants` should go first, because events with more attendees are more important. It is guaranteed that there are no events that have the same `event_date` and the same number of `participants`.\n",
